## About

I'm an Android and iOS developer based in Berlin.

## Open Source

- I'm the inventor of [AndroidKit](http://mschmitt.info/AKProject), a port of major CocoaTouch frameworks to Android.

- My latest project is a [TV-Guide app](https://github.com/m6s/xmltv) for Android which can connect to XMLTV servers.
